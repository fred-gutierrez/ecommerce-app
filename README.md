# Ecommerce App Project
 
## Overview
This is an ecommerce website project built using React, Bootstrap, TypeScript, and Sass. It provides the essential functionality to add and remove products from a shopping cart, making it a great starting point for an ecommerce platform.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for easy management and customization of website elements.
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is used for styling and layout. It provides a responsive design and a set of pre-designed components that enhance the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to add static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch potential errors early in the development process and improve code maintainability.
- **Sass**: Sass is used for efficient and maintainable CSS styling. It allows for the use of variables, nesting, and other advanced CSS features.
